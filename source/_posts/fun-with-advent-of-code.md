Today is first of December, and apart from the advent calendar my mum made for me (yes, I'm 25, and I still love it ðŸ˜„), I'm diving in to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/). Looking forward to it as it's a good chance to practice some problem-solving skills, and a perfect way of learning a new language or so I heard.
 
I will practice my Python skills a bit, as I feel they lack a bit now when I'm moving into a more dev-opsy/infrastructure oriented role at work. Probably I'll need the skills to write automation scripts and I believe Node.js, that I've done most automation with (in addition to good old sh scripts, that is) might not be the best fit. Python, in contrast to Node, comes pre-installed on virtually every Linux distro (ok, maybe not Arch, but you kinda need to bring it there too) and is more or less the standard for opsy things as I've understood it.

I'd really encourage fellow developers to take on the Advent of Code to maybe explore some programming language or skill set you normally don't use :)

If you're interested, you can find my solutions on [github.com/palmenhq/aoc-2020](https://github.com/palmenhq/aoc-2020/).

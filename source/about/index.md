Hello, I'm Johan Palmfjord üëã I like code and techno. However this website is mostly about code and things related.

Within coding I currently specialize in full-stack development with React, Node and Java/Kotlin. But I tend to stay curious, so this tech is likely to change as I and the world develop further.

You can of course find the source code for this website at [github.com/palmenhq/palmenhq.github.io](https://github.com/palmenhq/palmenhq.github.io).

This website was built on top of [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) and with [probberechts/hexo-theme-cactus](https://github.com/probberechts/hexo-theme-cactus#install), many thanks for the awesome tooling. One day I will probably make my own theme (or fork this one), but until then this theme seems excellent üôè
